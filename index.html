                <p class="card-text">An orthopedic mattress, commonly referred to as an ortho mattress, is a type of
                    mattress specifically designed to provide optimal support and alignment for the spine, joints, and
                    muscles. Here are some key details about ortho mattresses:</p>
                <p class="card-text"><small>
                        Ortho mattresses are engineered to provide firmer support compared to traditional mattresses.
                        They aim to maintain the natural curvature of the spine, promoting proper alignment and reducing
                        pressure points, particularly in areas such as the lower back, hips, and shoulders.
                        <br>
                        Ortho mattresses are designed to alleviate pressure points by distributing weight evenly across
                        the surface of the mattress. This helps to reduce discomfort and improve blood circulation,
                        which can be particularly beneficial for individuals with back pain or joint issues.
                        <br>
                        By promoting proper spinal alignment and reducing pressure points, ortho mattresses can
                        contribute to better sleep quality and overall well-being. Many people experience improved
                        comfort and reduced pain when sleeping on an ortho mattress.
